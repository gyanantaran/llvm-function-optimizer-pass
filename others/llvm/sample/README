This document refers to the steps that need to be followed to set up your project. 

(1) First copy this sample folder to your local directory, say ~/home/xyz/sample.   

(2) Create a obj folder at the same level as sample, say ~/home/xyz/obj and also create a directory to install the libraries called opt at ~/home/xyz/opt 

(3) Configure the build system in the obj (alias for build) directory: 

~/home/xyz/obj$ ../sample/configure --with-llvmsrc=/srv/shared_directory/llvm/3.4-install/src/llvm \
                                    --with-llvmobj=/srv/shared_directory/llvm/3.4-install/build \
                                    --prefix=/home/firstname.lastname@plaksha.edu.in

(4) Create a new directory for any new set of passes you want to add within the lib
directory, create .cpp files within that directory while the include directory has 
.h files required by the .cpp files. Add the new directory to the Makefile in the lib directory.   

(5) Once you have created a new pass within that directory, you can build it and test
it out as follows:

~/home/xyz/obj$ gmake install

llvm[0]: Regenerating /afs/glue.umd.edu/home/glue/a/k/akotha/home/llvm/obj/Makefile.common
config.status: creating Makefile.common
gmake[1]: Entering directory `/afs/glue.umd.edu/home/glue/a/k/akotha/home/llvm/obj/lib'
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/afs/glue.umd.edu/home/glue/a/k/akotha/home/llvm/obj/lib/Hello'
llvm[2]: Compiling Hello.cpp for Release build  (PIC)
llvm[2]: Linking Release Shared Library Hello1.so
llvm[2]: Linking Release Object Library Hello1.o
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/afs/glue.umd.edu/home/glue/a/k/akotha/home/llvm/obj/lib/Hello'
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/afs/glue.umd.edu/home/glue/a/k/akotha/home/llvm/obj/lib'

[There would be many more lines ... only few reproduced here] (NOTE: this was generated on a different machine)

(6) Set the PATH variable to also have the llvm installation as follows:

~/home/xyz/obj: export PATH=/srv/shared_directory/llvm/3.4-install/install/bin:$PATH

Check that the installation is correct as follows 

~/home/xyz/obj: opt --version
LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 3.4.2
  Optimized build with assertions.
  Built Oct 25 2023 (01:11:55).
  Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: x86-64

(7) You can run your pass as follows:

~/home/xyz/obj: opt -load ../opt/lib/libHello.so -hello /srv/shared_directory/llvm/test_codes/example1.bc -o example1.bc

[The output should look like]

Hello: main


(8) You should now be set to do your project :)
